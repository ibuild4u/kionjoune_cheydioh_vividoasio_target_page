# Property Data Fetcher

This script processes Zillow property URLs and generates structured property data.

## Usage

```bash
node fetch_properties.js
```

## Input

Reads from: `../a_variable/url.json`

Expected format:
```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "id": "property_01",
      "link": "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output

Writes to: `../c_output/fetched.json`

Output format:
```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "id": "property_01",
      "link": "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/...",
      "address": "200 River Vista Dr UNIT 743, Sandy Springs, GA 30339",
      "totalPrice": 450000,
      "monthlyRent": 2800,
      "estimatedMonthlyPayment": 3200,
      "bedrooms": 2,
      "bathrooms": 2,
      "sqft": 1200
    }
  ]
}
```

## Current Implementation

The current version extracts the address from the URL but creates placeholder values (0) for:
- totalPrice
- monthlyRent
- estimatedMonthlyPayment
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- sqft

## Future Enhancement

To get actual property data, you would need to:

1. **Use Zillow API** (if available/authorized)
2. **Use web scraping** with puppeteer/playwright:
   ```bash
   npm install puppeteer
   ```
3. **Use a third-party real estate API** like RapidAPI's Zillow endpoints

## Manual Data Entry

For now, you can:
1. Run the script to generate the structure
2. Manually update the property details in `fetched.json`
3. Use this as your data source for your application
